# Alpha-Discord-Bot

These are the files for a Discord bot.

I made this bot from youtube as i don't have much experience with discord.py or python!

Default command prefix is '.$'

anyways in 'Main.py' please replace the following:
1. TOKEN='your_token'
2. for filename in os.listdir("path_of_the_folder_named_cogs")
3. c_preifx='.$' please change this to anything you like
4.  your_user_id this with your user id in 'cogs/kill.py'
only then this bot will work!

NOTE-
Setup a text channel named log-channel for auto logging to work!
Events.py is autolog!

Thank you!
