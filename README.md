# Alpha-Discord-Bot

These are the files for a Discord bot.

I made this bot from youtube as i don't have much experience with discord.py or python!

Default command prefix is '.$'

please replace the following:
1. TOKEN='your_token'
2. for filename in os.listdir("path_of_the_folder_named_cogs")
3. c_preifx='.$' please change this to anything you like this will be your new command prefix
4. your_user_id this with your user id in 'cogs/kill.py'
5. your_user_id this with your user id in 'cogs/guild_leave.py'
6. your_user_id this your user id in 'cogs/Get_Client_Guilds.py'
7. your_user_id this your user id in 'cogs/Guild_Leave.py'
only then this bot will work!


NOTE-
Setup a text channel named log-channel for auto logging to work!
Events.py is autolog!

Thank you!
